## AdoptMeNow
### AdoptMeNow is a full stack, MVC (Model-View-Controller) application that connects people in their area and helps streamline and simplify the pet adoption process. With this application, you can do the following:

* Take a compatibility assessment and receive suggested pets that reflect your personality, preferences, and interests.
Save your assessment results.
* Search for adoptable pets at animal shelters in your area based on your assessment results. You can search by breed, type, gender, age, and other attributes. 

#### How the app is built
This project uses MySQL, Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and Sequelize. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the application. Express is the backend web framework used for this application, and Handlebars is a templating language that is used to generate the HTML. Sequelize is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper), which helps in managing database queries in an effective manner.

#### MVC design pattern
This project also follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. The MVC design pattern assigns objects in the application one of three roles (model, view, or controller) and defines the way the different parts of the application communicate with one another.


#### How the App Works 
This project is a full stack application that helps simplify the pet adoption process. The application is meant to help connect you with animal shelters in your area.

When you first start using the app, you will be taken to the home screen. When you get to the home screen of the app, you have two options. You can log in to the app and take a compatibility assessment, which takes you through a series of questions and matches you with a pet based on your personality, preferences, and interests. After you take the quiz, you will get your results back, and you can use those results and the pet search feature to search for matching pets in your area. At the end of the quiz, you also have the option to save your results to view later, which saves them to the My saved pets page as well as to the MySQL database.
