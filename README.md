## AdoptMeNow
### AdoptMeNow is a full stack, MVC (Model-View-Controller) application that connects people in their area and helps streamline and simplify the pet adoption process. With this application, you can do the following:

* Take a compatibility assessment and receive suggested pets that reflect your personality, preferences, and interests.
Save your assessment results.
* Search for adoptable pets at animal shelters in your area based on your assessment results. You can search by breed, type, gender, age, and other attributes. 

#### How the app is built
This project uses MySQL, Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and Sequelize. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the application. Express is the backend web framework used for this application, and Handlebars is a templating language that is used to generate the HTML. Sequelize is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper), which helps in managing database queries in an effective manner.

#### MVC design pattern
This project also follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. The MVC design pattern assigns objects in the application one of three roles (model, view, or controller) and defines the way the different parts of the application communicate with one another.
